You and me are electricity
You and me, electricity
You and me are electricity
You and me, electricity

I'm burning through
When I am near you
I feel such a rush
Need it so much from you
And now,
I'm so isolated cause,
You give me it all
Then take it I fall
Without you

You and me are electricity
You and me, electricity
You and me are electricity
You and me, electricity

And now, I'm so isolated cause
I'm sick with no touch
I miss so much
Can't be with you now
It's much too much
Without you
Without you

You and me are electricity
You and me, electricity
You and me are electricity
You and me, electricity
