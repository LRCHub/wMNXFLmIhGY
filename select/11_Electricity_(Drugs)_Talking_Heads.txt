And all I see is little dots
Some are smeared, some are spots
Feel like a murder but that's alright
Somebody said there's too much light
Pull down that shade and it's alright
It'll be over in a minute or two

I'm charged up, don't put me down
Don't feel like talking, don't mess around
I feel mean, but I feel okay
I'm charged up, electricity
Is that what you calling

The boys are making a big mess
This makes the girls all start to laugh
I don't know what they're talking about
The boys are worried, the girls are shocked
They pick the sound and let it drop
Nobody knows what they're talking about

I'm charged up, [Incomprehensible]
Don't tell the truth, I just tell lies
I'm picking up, but I left off
I'm charged up, it's pretty intense

I'm charged up, don't put me down
Don't feel like talking, don't mess around
And I feel mean, I feel okay
I'm charged up, electricity
That's right, [Incomprehensible]
